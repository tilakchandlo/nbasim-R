# list of files

## boxscore.csv
boxscores from 2004-2013
downloaded from http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/fast-summary-statistics-with-data-dot-table.html

Some work needs to be done to get dates to import properly, also want to create 'year' column

## dailyfantasy.R
functions for daily fantasy sites
for example, calculate DK fantasy points from raw stats

## nbasim.R
functions for fantasy simulation of nba season
can be run in parallel or individually
have separate scripts to simulate positional scarcity

## doug.R
functions for importing/scraping from dougstats.com

## RDS files
these are self explanatory, mostly sim results
long-term probably no need to keep these around
